# Benfica Games Webscrapper

This repository contains a simple python script that fetches the agenda of my club Sport Lisboa e Benfica and then writes the games of 8 different team sports(masculine and feminine) to my public Google calendar.

This script is executed 3 times a day via a Github Action Workflow.

The club doesnt provide the games in the calendar for all of these sports neither has an API to easily fetch this, so I had to work my way around the lack of information/tooling provided to interested supporters ðŸ˜….

You can access the the calendar [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=YmRmMTZiNjE1MDQwYzY0MGRmMjU3NmNhYzNiODBjM2FiNjBjNjA3NjYyMTA3NmZmODAzNWZkMGViZWQ3YmNkN0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t).

For ideas or requests for implementation you can create a Github Issue.
For requests to contribute you can or email goncalo.mestre1998@gmail.com.
